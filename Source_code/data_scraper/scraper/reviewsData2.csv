Nice to talk to.2) Newly refurbished room, good decor","1) Why does a 5 star hotel requires guests, upon check in, to sign a piece of printed one page statement that states that due to covid restrictions the undersigned (guest) is/are only allowed to have 2 people in the room??? very weird. Before checking in to this Hilton hotel, I just checked out from Andaz Singapore, and they didn't require us to sign the same piece of paper.2) I have had better services & hospitality with other 5 star hotels, especially at 400 SGD/ night.3) You can hear clearly every conversation from the corridor, especially in the room placed right in front of the lift lobby of the given floor. I am not sure if this is suitable for a 5 star hotel.4) I checked in at 11 AM, got my room at 10 PM. Understaffed? I would give the benefit of doubt that they were just trying to serve me a cleaner room. Also, they told me that once the room was ready I would receive an SMS, but none was received.additional: The hotel is comprised out of two towers that is staggered as an ""L"", thus some rooms directly faces their other tower, for me this room does not worth 400 SGD/ night even if the service is great, which it isn't. If you do get a good price for this hotel, say 200 SGD all inclusive, and are just looking for a clean and newly renovated room to sleep in during the night in a hotel by the Orchard Road, go book this hotel.Hilton, some things you can't change, but on point 1,2,3, and 4 you can.

But if you worked in hospitality industry, whatever the reason was, you can't be rude to the hotel guests. The receptionist was so-so. Mandarin Orchard provide much better service. And I do expect the same from Hilton Orchard (big hotel chain with years of experience in its field). To top it off, we found 2 bugs on our bed.

On top of that, we were told that we could only get into the room after 2-3hrs as they have manpower issue for housekeeping due to the travel demand right now. A few of the guests wanted to speak with the manager but the staff told them the manager couldn't be found? I've never heard that in a hotel service line before with so many years of travelling or staycations. We couldn't afford to wait for 3hrs as we had a line of events planned for our dear friend therefore we had to cancel (with no penalty) and rebook another hotel.
